.NET Core C# WebAPI backend for the TapMango coding challenge.

This is a proof of concept, and I did not add it directly to the front-end both for simplicity's sake, and I ran into some CORS issues that I did not have time to fix.

The code I added is under the "Models", "Controller", and "Repositories" folders, and the program.cs file.
